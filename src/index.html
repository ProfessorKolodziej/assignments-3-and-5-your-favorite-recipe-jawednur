			<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
			<h3> Making the Scones</h3>
			<p> Scones are very easy to make, here are my tips to ensure they're perfect everytime:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use cold butter and keep the butter in the fridge until ready to use. The cold butter creates pockets
					giving layers and a flaky texture.</li>
				<li>Mix the dough using a pastry cutter and a spoon, not a mixer. Fold the cheese into the flour mixture
					before adding the liquid</li>
				<li>Work quickly to handle the dough as little as possible.</li>
				<li>When patting out the dough, very lightly flour your surface if needed, I prefer to work on parchment
					paper. Try not to add too much extra flour, this will make the dough dense.</li>
			</ul>

				alt="Ingredients being mixed with a Pastry Cutter, then cheese is added">

			<h3>Storing the Scones</h3>
			<p>You can freeze scones before baking meaning scones fresh from the oven any time!</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To freeze before baking, prepare scones as directed and cut into wedges. Freeze on a baking sheet until
					firm. Once firm, place in a zippered freezer bag for up to 3 months.</li>
				<li>To bake from frozen, remove the scones from the freezer for about 20 minutes before baking (while the
					oven preheats). Preheat oven to 400°F and bake for 18-22 minutes or until baked through</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Scones can be kept in a zippered bag or an airtight container at room temperature for about 2 days. Keep a
				slice of bread in the bag with them to absorb moisture so they stay fresher longer.</p>

			<h2>Cheddar Cheese Scones</h2>
			<article>
				<p> Scones are the English partner to American biscuits — and these are upscaled for any time
					enjoyment! While scones often have added fruits (like blueberries or cranberries), I personally
					prefer a savory addition, like Cabot Seriously Sharp Cheddar and a sprinkle of chives.
					Some store-bought scones can be dense, but not these! They're extra light and fluffy with a rich
					savory cheddar cheese flavor.</p>
				<p>They're quick and easy to make and all you need is a bowl, a wooden spoon and some great
					cheese!</p>

				<h2>What's in a Cheese Scone?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li class="What-is-item">BASE The base of this recipe has easy to find ingredients with flour, cream, and
						eggs with
						baking powder to help them rise.</li>
					<li class="What-is-item">CHEESE This is where the magic comes in and since the cheese adds so much flavor

					<li class="What-is-item">CHEESE This is where the magic comes in and since the cheese adds so much flavor
						to these
						scones, I chose Cabot Seriously Sharp Cheddar Cheese. This cheese is deliciously rich adding
						flavor to every bite. The cheese is folded into the dough ensuring savory goodness you can see
						throughout the flaky layers.</li>
					<li class="What-is-item">Cabot is a cooperative owned by over 800 farm families in New York and New
						England. They
						truly produce the best cheeses which are 100% naturally aged and naturally lactose-free! They
						are a certified B corporation which means they meet the highest standards of social and
						environmental performance.</li>
